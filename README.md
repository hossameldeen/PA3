# Semantic Analyzer for COOL

Made for Compilers course @ FCI-CU, 2015. A slightly-slimmed version of Stanford Compilers' semantic analyzer assignment. Exact assignment description is [here](https://github.com/hossameldeenfci/PA3/blob/master/FCI_2015_Compilers_Assignment_3_SemanticAnalyzer.pdf).

Most of the work done by us can be found in [cool-tree.h](https://github.com/hossameldeenfci/PA3/blob/master/phase3/cool-tree.h) and [semant.cc](https://github.com/hossameldeenfci/PA3/blob/master/phase3/semant.cc)
