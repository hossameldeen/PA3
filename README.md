# Semantic Analyzer for Cool

Made for Compilers course @ FCI-CU, 2015. Not meant to be used by the public. Assignment description is here http://www.acadox.com/class/16939#resources

Some notes to myself:
Do NOT forget to check for double definition. i.e., if something has been defined twice.


Will write here last commit's changes:
- Implemented no_expr_class::traverse().
